# Cars-price-prediction
Started off with 19 predictor variables to predict the price of pre-owned cars. This was followed by data cleaning in which missing values and outliers were taken care of. Fitted a multiple linear regression model on the data set and found that the model was significant. Applied variable selection algorithms to check for variables which were actually significant.
